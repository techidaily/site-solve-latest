## The City of Munich relies on ABBYY to digitise its building files

July 09, 2018

ABBYY Europe, a leading provider of document recognition, data capture and linguistic technologies and services, is supporting Munich, the capital of Bavaria, with the digitisation of building files in the Urban Planning and Building Regulations department. The goal of the project is to create a digital base for application processing, thus simplifying the processing of construction applications. The manual work involved in incoming building applications will be kept to a minimum by automatically digitising and classifying files, ensuring a higher throughput rate for application processing.

The Urban Planning and Building Regulations department is the construction authority for Bavaria’s capital. In addition to urban renewal, urban development and land-use planning, the department is responsible for issuing building permits. In this capacity, the department deals with around 6,000 to 7,000 applications for building permits each year. To optimise the permit process, all relevant data is extracted from the incoming building files after digitisation and classification and is then transferred into the e-files. The City of Munich has set up a new working group for building file digitisation, where up to 3 million incoming pages of paper can be processed per year. The new ABBYY FlexiCapture for Mailrooms solution was connected to the e-file sub-module through an interface. Along with the relevant metadata, the scanned documents are then made available for digital use in PDF/A format.

“We opted for ABBYY because it has already successfully implemented similar large-scale projects throughout Europe in the past,” says the project manager for the City of Munich. “ABBYY’s project management was exemplary, and implementation was quick and smooth.”

[ABBYY FlexiCapture for Mailrooms](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) is an intelligent solution for automating the incoming mail of customer-oriented companies and helps them to manage their information flow in a way that ensures that the right information is available to the right employee at the right time. Based on the award-winning [ABBYY Enterprise Capture Platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), FlexiCapture for Mailrooms reliably classifies all incoming mail, from paper documents to faxes and e-mails. Thanks to innovative document classification and data capture technologies, the solution offers all functions required for quick, cost-effective and transparent incoming mail automation. ABBYY’s incoming mail solution masters multi-channel input in just one system, and thanks to easy integration in company processes and systems, it contributes significantly towards maximising productivity, improving customer loyalty and accelerating decision-making processes.
