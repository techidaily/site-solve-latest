#### If you wanna convert MKV to MP4:

Just select "MP4" as output file format. To play MKV on Mac with QuickTime, [import MKV to iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), convert MKV to AVI, M4V, MOV, 3GP, other supported formats.

You can also compress the MKV video using featurs like crop, trim and parameter adjustment. To trim and crop unnecessary parts, click the Edit button.

As MKV is often large in size, converting MKV to other formats for playback on Mac may take quite a long time. The [MKV video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) has two advanced features built-in that is able to speed up HD/4K MKV video processing by times faster. Do remember to check the two features on the right lower part of the interface.  
 \* Level-3 Hardware Acceleration - apply GPU acceleration of Intel, Nvidia and AMD to decode and encode MKV H.265/H.264\. This feature speed up MKV HEVC conversion to solve [MKV HEVC files not playing on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) error.

## Method 4: Using MKV Player for Mac

What plays MKV files on Mac computer perfectly? Not QuickTime, not VLC, what I'm going to recommend here is a newbie, [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), a fantastic [MKV video player for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that I came across accidentally on forum.

It plays MKV video in 720p, 1080p, or 4K UHD on macOS Sierra, Mac El Capitan, Yosemite, OS X 10 without freezing or buffering. It takes no time to fully load MKV file. The player for MKV also plays AVI, FLV, MOV, MTS, MP4, MP3 music, AAC, to name just a few.

Another feature that impresses me is that it is able to airplay MKV video movie from Mac to Mac, from Mac to Apple TV. This means that you can watch MKV on Mac even on airplay supported TV with no limits.

## How to Fix: VLC Won't Play MKV File on macOS

Will VLC play MKV files on Mac? Yes, but not smoothly, common issues are MKV files audio not working on VLC, some MKV files not loading, open successfully, Skipping, Chopping, VLC does not support the audio or video format, etc. If you still prefer to using VLC media player, the following tips of [VLC player not playing MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) may help you out, if it still fails to work, try other players.

Set all preferences before back to default, close the player, execute the reset and re-open VLC player. If that doesn't help, the most straightforward solution to let VLC play MKV files on Mac smoothly is simple, convert MKV in 720P, or HD files to VLC formats with MKV video converter. VLC player reads several formats on Mac OS X, including MP4, QuickTime format, 3GP, VOB, TS, AVI, FLV, ASF, Ogg, WAV, , MPS, etc.

### Bonus Tip

\* Apple official applications on Mac such as QuickTime Player works with many kinds of audio and video formats, like AVI, FLV, DivX, and many more.  
\* Perian is not perfect, though. It only works with QT 10 or lower for it stops being updated. You may still have some problems when playing MKV on Mac. Some users are crying that they downloaded Perian, and MKV are played on QT but with no sound. And it has to read the MKV file before playing, you can not fast forward file that has not been fully loaded.   
\* It's better to use MKV video converter to convert the file first and watch MKV on Mac freely, or jump to method 3, resort to a MKV player for Mac.  
\* Big Sur (macOS 10.15) is killing off 32-bit apps. Many legacy versions of Mac apps like GarageBand, and Perian are unsupported. So to play MKV with success on your new mac operating system, make sure it is new and upgrade for the 64-bit computer.
