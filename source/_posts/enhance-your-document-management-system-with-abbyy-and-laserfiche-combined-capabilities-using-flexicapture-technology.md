#### The combination of ABBYY + Laserfiche technologies 

Laserfiche Enterprise Content Management system accumulates business data from corporate databases, billing and accounting systems, .CSV files, or data uploaded manually by employees. Yet, large portions of corporate data are missing, because they come inside papers, email attachments, scans, and image-only files. With ABBYY FlexiCapture add-on for Laserfiche, they automatically appear in the repository for driving deals, better compliance, faster customer service, and more.

## How ABBYY and Laserfiche work together 

FlexiCapture for Laserfiche automates the journey of valuable data locked in documents and emails—from arrival to the ECM system—and makes them usable inside corporate workflows. Text and image content is accurately processed no matter the channel, classified by predefined rules or types (agreements, invoices, etc.), and the key data is extracted directly to the Laserfiche repository.
