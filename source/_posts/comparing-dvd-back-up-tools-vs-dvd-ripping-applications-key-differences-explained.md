Nowadays, we may more or less own some DVD discs, which may be either purchased from stores or received as special gifts taken by camcorders from friends. However, we may easily find that DVDs can be scratched, damaged and even completely unusable. To solve the problems, DVD backup software and ripping software are therefore available for better protection of DVD library on your computer. But how DVD ripper differs from DVD backup software? Here I'd like to make a comparison between DVD backup software and [DVD ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for Mac/PC. 

## Differences between DVD Backup and Ripper Software 

### What Is DVD Backup Software

The name articulates it well. [DVD backup software](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) permits you to copy DVD movies to store them on your computer hard drive, NAS or USB in order to play with media player or burn then to vacant DVDs. In the other word, there is almost no codec transcoding involved in the process of copying DVD with DVD backup software.

Pros:

• Since there is no video compression involved, the video quality will be almost untouchable. And the 5.1 channel AC3/DTS dolby audio will be reserved. 

• DVD information such as video tracks, audio tracks, subtitles, menus and more can be retained well. 

• DVD backup software generally delivers a superfast speed. Most often, a full DVD disc can be backed up on computer hard drive in less than 10 minutes. 

Cons:

• The output file size will be as large as 4-8GB as the DVD content isn't compressed. 

• DVD backup program generally saves DVDs in MPG, ISO image, or video\_ts folder, which is not so much compatible with mobile devices or gaming systems.

### What Is DVD Ripper

Different from DVD copy software, it's understood clearly that DVD ripper is a software program that transfers audio/video contents from DVDs into different formats, for instance, the hierarchy of files making up the audio/video data on DVD can be converted into other single file such as AVI, FLV, MP4, MOV, H.264, MP3, and more for playback on media players and portable devices like iPhone, iPad, iPod, Android, gaming systems and so on.

Pros:

• DVD ripper delivers less file size than that of DVD copy software, courtesy of its built-in video transcoding engine. So it is more friendly than DVD backup tool if you want to store more movie files in a space-constrained device. 

• DVD ripping software can digitize DVD to a diversity of file format, including MP4, MOV, AVI, and more, so that the rips are more recognizable by common mobile phones, tablets, TVs, laptops, game consoles, etc. 

Cons:

 The DVD quality is degraded to some degree. This is down to involvement of video compression in the process of ripping. As a result, you will notice the DVD content gets pixilated or blurry if it is ripped not so well. 

• DVD ripping speed is comparatively lengthier than that of DVD backup software. This is because the DVD ripping process involves in decoding and re-encoding, which don't appear in the DVD backup. So if you want a faster process, you have to turn to DVD backup software.
