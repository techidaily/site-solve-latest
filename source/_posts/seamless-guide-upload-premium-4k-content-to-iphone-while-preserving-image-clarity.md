## Advantages of Downloading 4K Ultra HD Video to iPhone 6 and Later

**1\. Bandwidth saving.** A high bandwidth is the prerequisite for a successful [4K streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) on iPhone. Generally, if you have a less than 15 Mbps bandwidth, Ultra HD streaming is little more than a pipe dream. To say the least, watching a lot of videos over a 3G or 4G wireless connection can eat up your monthly bandwidth limit quickly. But once you finish the task of 4k ultra HD download from YouTube to iPhone 6 or later devices, bandwidth will never be an issue. 

**2\. Space saving.** It's known to all the more pixels there is in a video means the more file size that it takes. The recent research shows a 4k uncompressed trailer version of the famous movie The Amazing Spiderman takes an enormous 500GB of hard disk space. The best way to avoid such space occupation is to download ultra HD video from YouTube and compress 4K video to iPhone supported video format, such that the huge file can be shrunk down to a more manageable size.
