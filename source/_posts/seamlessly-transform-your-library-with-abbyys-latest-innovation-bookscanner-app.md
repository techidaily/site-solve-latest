## ABBYY Releases BookScanner, a New App That Makes Scanning Books Completely Effortless

November 17, 2016

ABBYY®, a world leader in document capture and language-related technologies, has released BookScanner, a new powerful mobile scanner created specifically for scanning books with superior quality and accuracy.

BookScanner turns any iOS device into a smart scanner to capture book pages two times faster, create electronic copies in PDF, JPG, DOCX, TXT, EPUB or FB2 and recognize text on scans via online OCR for further editing and sharing.

The new application is based on ABBYY’s proprietary technology, which builds on more than 2 years of intensive R&D. BookScanner automatically recognizes book pages, splits a shot of facing pages into two separate single-page images, and corrects curved lines, optical distortions, and lighting defects.

“We are committed to creating and improving technologies that action information when and where our users need it the most. We are especially excited to help schools and universities, students and teachers, to make educational process easier and more effective. That is the idea behind our new app BookScanner,” said Artem Kumpel, ABBYY’s Vice President and Head of Mobile.

BookScanner is designed to make scanning books and documents completely intuitive and effortless, replacing a desktop scanner. All the user has to do is hold their smartphone over an open book, BookScanner does the rest. Captured pages can be saved in JPEG, PDF formats or sent for recognition. ABBYY’s internationally appraised optical character recognition technology (OCR) digitizes printed text with unprecedented accuracy in 193 languages (including Latin, Cyrillic and CJK alphabets) preserving the original formatting such as lists, tables and headers. The available formats for a recognized document are PDF, DOCX, TXT, EPUB or FB2 – 12 most popular output formats in total. This means that BookScanner gives users a chance to create their own ebooks with capabilities to edit, search, save and share them.

The result can be saved in the built in storage with tags and search capabilities, a cloud storage of choice (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, Yandex.Disk, Evernote and more), transferred to a MAC or PC with iTunes sharing and sent via email or iMessage.

Users can add passwords to their PDF files, use image filters, enable the best-shot mode and find scans straight from the home screen using Spotlight search.

BookScanner is available on the App Store for $19.99\. The app is compatible with iOS 8.0 or later running on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
