First, NAS has some distinct advantages over flash drive, HD, and Cloud. The key benefits of a NAS are large storage capacity, safe data backup, much easier file accessibility and low cost. See the main advantages of NAS below. 

**1\. Storage Capacity**   
 Flash drive, [external hard drive](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and Cloud service are good choices to deal with small-sized data backup. However, when it comes to a few hundred GB or even 1TB file storage, NAS comes to your first option. As mentioned above, a NAS can be attached with one or more hard drives, and can store even eight TB data. More hard drives can be added to NAS if more storage is needed.
