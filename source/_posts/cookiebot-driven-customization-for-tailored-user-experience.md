## ABBYY Named a Leader in IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing Software 2023–2024 Vendor Assessment

After a thorough evaluation of ABBYY’s strategies and capabilities, IDC has positioned the company in the Leaders category in the 2023-2024 IDC MarketScape for worldwide intelligent document processing software. 

This inaugural report by IDC examines AI technologies such as optical character recognition (OCR), computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and machine/deep learning to classify and extract information from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents.

IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each vendor’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures vendor product, go-to-market and business execution in the short-term. The Strategy score measures alignment of vendor strategies with customer requirements in a 3-5-year timeframe. Vendor market share is represented by the size of the icons.

ABBYY is known for its extensive expertise in structured and semi-structured document classification and extraction and continues to extend its customer deals further into unstructured documents.

IDC MarketScape

In an increasingly crowded IDP vendor landscape, ABBYY stands out for its 30 years of experience in the market, large IDP customer base, competitive pricing, and its online marketplace offering over 150 pre-trained document models.

ABBYY often offers customers multiple approaches/options to address an IDP use case. This choice allows customers to build solutions based on their requirements (e.g., speed, cost, accuracy/precision) rather than utilizing a single approach that will be applied universally across all customer use cases.
