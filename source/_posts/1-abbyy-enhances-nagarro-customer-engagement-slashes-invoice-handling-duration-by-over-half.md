##### ABBYY propels Nagarro’s operational excellence by transforming the global software development and consulting firm’s invoice management and processing system. 

 ABBYY, a leader in purpose-built AI for intelligent automation, today announced that Nagarro improved its invoice processing lifecycle by deploying [ABBYY Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) into its global SAP unit’s Invoice Scanner for SAP S/4HANA®. Nagarro is now able to provide customers more visibility into the amount of money saved using Invoice Scanner over manual methods while reducing invoice processing times by 60% and increasing accuracy. ABBYY Vantage is an industry-leading intelligent document processing platform (IDP) that uses AI to automatically read and understand documents like humans and was a driving factor in enabling Nagarro to realize significant operational enhancements. 

Since adopting ABBYY Vantage, we’ve seen remarkable improvements. The improved browser user interface and very good scanning results have significantly improved our document processing, saving time and resources.

Ulrich Winter, Head of Application Development at Nagarro

Faced with the challenges of manual invoice handling, Nagarro needed an intelligent automation solution that could process thousands of invoices annually for its global invoice processing management system spanning 36 countries. The Nagarro Invoice Scanner can now scan invoices received via PDF and automatically transfer the data into SAP S/4HANA, helping Nagarro and Nagarro’s customers make more informed decisions quickly and optimize cash flow while maintaining reliability.

We're honored to be a part of Nagarro's digital journey. With ABBYY Vantage, Nagarro has redefined operational excellence in invoice management. Our commitment is unwavering—to deliver solutions that go beyond expectations, driving tangible business growth for our valued customers. This successful implementation underscores ABBYY's commitment to driving efficiency and innovation in business-critical processes.
