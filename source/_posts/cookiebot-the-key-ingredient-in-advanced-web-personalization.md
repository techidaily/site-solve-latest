IDP adoption not only helps enterprises achieve cost savings, but also improves their workforce productivity and employee and customer experience. IDP technology providers are increasingly offering low-code/no-code platforms to enable citizen developers to configure the platforms. They are enhancing their capabilities and functionalities and allowing users to interact with documents via natural language by integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). In the full report, we assess IDP software products that leverage AI / cognitive capabilities / generative AI and are available for independent licensing. They are offered either as platforms that allow enterprises to deploy out-of-the-box solutions using pre-built modules or as solutions to buyers with the intent of classifying and extracting data from documents. The report features providers on three Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), Banking-specific IDP, and Insurance-specific IDP Products PEAK Matrix ® Assessments 2024 , one for the overall IDP landscape, one for the banking-specific IDP landscape, and one for the insurance-specific IDP landscape. Based on the comprehensive Everest Group PEAK Matrix evaluation, each of the 26 IDP technology providers are segmented into the categories of Leaders, Major Contenders, Aspirants, and Star Performers. We focus on:  Everest Group’s PEAK Matrix evaluation, a comparative assessment of 26 leading IDP technology providers  Everest Group’s PEAK Matrix evaluation, a comparative assessment of 10 leading IDP technology providers for banking-specific processes  Everest Group’s PEAK Matrix evaluation, a comparative assessment of 10 leading IDP technology providers for insurance-specific processes  Overview of IDP software products  Competitive landscape of the IDP technology provider market  Remarks on key strengths and limitations for each IDP technology provider  IDP product capability trends and predictions

ABBYY also provides its proprietary OCR (FineReader), process intelligence solution (Timeline), and partners with a large number of complementary technology providers  It offers HITL feature for feedback-based learning of the model and has the ability to leverage generative AI for software learning and training and synthetic data generation for training ML models. Clients appreciate its ease of use in terms of training the model  ABBYY provides an online marketplace for pre-built models or skills, custom solution packages, and third- party connectors. Clients have also appreciated the breadth of the marketplace  The solution has the ability to provide domain-specific training data for entity recognition and the ability for business users to add, configure, and manage validation rules using external data  It leverages generative AI to recognize sentiments from text, summarize documents, extract key-value pairs from complex documents, and compare documents. It also offers a pre-built connector with generative AI/LLMs including ChatGPT  It can be deployed on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. It is also available as a SaaS offering and supports multi-tenant operations. Clients highlighted its cloud offering as one of its strengths Limitations  ABBYY has rich experience in serving clients from banking and capital markets, public sector, professional services, and manufacturing. Its experience in serving hi-tech and telecom, media and entertainment, CPG and retail, and travel and logistics sectors is relatively low  Though the platform offers semantic search capabilities for scanned documents and PDFs, the ability to query documents in Q&A fashion using generative AI is currently not available and is in the roadmap  Its ability to predict the likelihood of future events (e.g., loan default) based on understanding of the document is in the roadmap  Currently, ABBYY Vantage does not offer a chat interface to answer user queries around analytics and reports generation by leveraging generative AI/LLM  Clients expect ABBYY to improve reporting capabilities, especially for Straight Through Processing (STP) rate, to help users know when manual verification of a document can be skipped  Clients wish to see improvement in its query resolution time and ease of version control. They also expect ABBYY to add more pre-trained models for banking use cases ABBYY profile (page 6 of 6) Everest Group overall IDP assessment – Leader

ABBYY also provides its proprietary OCR (FineReader), process intelligence solution (Timeline), and partners with a large number of complementary technology providers  It offers HITL feature for feedback-based learning of the model and has the ability to leverage generative AI for software learning and training and synthetic data generation for training ML models. Clients appreciate its ease of use in terms of training the model  ABBYY provides an online marketplace for pre-built models or skills, custom solution packages, and third- party connectors. Clients have also appreciated the breadth of the marketplace  The solution has the ability to provide domain-specific training data for entity recognition and the ability for business users to add, configure, and manage validation rules using external data  It leverages generative AI to recognize sentiments from text, summarize documents, extract key-value pairs from complex documents, and compare documents. It also offers a pre-built connector with generative AI/LLMs including ChatGPT  It can be deployed on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. It is also available as a SaaS offering and supports multi-tenant operations. Clients highlighted its cloud offering as one of its strengths Limitations  ABBYY has rich experience in serving clients from banking and capital markets, public sector, professional services, and manufacturing. Its experience in serving hi-tech and telecom, media and entertainment, CPG and retail, and travel and logistics sectors is relatively low  Though the platform offers semantic search capabilities for scanned documents and PDFs, the ability to query documents in Q&A fashion using generative AI is currently not available and is in the roadmap  Its ability to predict the likelihood of future events (e.g., loan default) based on understanding of the document is in the roadmap  Currently, ABBYY Vantage does not offer a chat interface to answer user queries around analytics and reports generation by leveraging generative AI/LLM  Clients expect ABBYY to improve reporting capabilities, especially for Straight Through Processing (STP) rate, to help users know when manual verification of a document can be skipped  Clients wish to see improvement in its query resolution time and ease of version control. They also expect ABBYY to add more pre-trained models for banking use cases ABBYY profile (page 6 of 6) Everest Group overall IDP assessment – Leader
