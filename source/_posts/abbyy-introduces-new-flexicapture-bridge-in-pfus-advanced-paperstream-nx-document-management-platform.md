#### _Fujitsu Image Scanner users can now access ABBYY FlexiCapture technology that captures data from any type of document and powers intelligent automation._

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a Digital Intelligence company, today announced the release of the ABBYY FlexiCapture Connector for [PFU’s PaperStream NX Manager](https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/fi/software/ps-nxmanager/ps-nxmanager.html). This connector enables Fujitsu Image Scanners to leverage the Content Intelligence capabilities of ABBYY FlexiCapture to extract business-critical data from unstructured and semi-structured documents, such as invoices and receipts. The solution accelerates automation of document-centric processes allowing organizations to optimise workflows, lower risks, and improve customer experience.

Provided with select models of Fujitsu Image Scanners, PaperStream NX Manager software enables seamless integration with various client systems and applications. The addition of the [ABBYY FlexiCapture](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) Connector allows PaperStream NX Manager users to instantly extract business data from the documents they just digitised with their Fujitsu Image Scanners.

ABBYY’s Content Intelligence technology transforms unstructured documents into structured, actionable information that is ready for further processing into enterprise applications including ERP, CRM, ECM, and RPA platforms.

The solution empowers the business user to access the relevant data immediately and get control over the process. With the ABBYY FlexiCapture Connector, digitisation of critical documents occurs at the point of origination making individual business units, as well as the organisation as a whole, more agile and effective at serving their customers more quickly.

“As workforces become increasingly decentralised and distributed, particularly in the midst of today’s crisis, it’s imperative that business users are equipped with the tools to assume a more active role in digital transformation initiatives,” commented **Markus Pichler, VP Sales Europe at ABBYY**. “By combining the powerful Digital Intelligence capabilities of ABBYY and the world-class scanning solutions from PFU, we empower the business user to intelligently automate complex document processes.”

“With ABBYY technology, we are able to provide even greater value to our customers and enable the world’s flow of knowledge,” said **Mike Nelson, Senior Vice President, PFU (EMEA) Limited**. “With ABBYY’s leading Content Intelligence capabilities, users can quickly and accurately process important enterprise documents, from invoices to receipts, helping streamline and reduce costs in mission-critical workflows. By enabling the automation of content-centric processes, PaperStream NX Manager with ABBYY FlexiCapture increases operational efficiency and revitalises customer experience.”

Customers who currently have PaperStream NX Manager now have access to ABBYY FlexiCapture Connector free of charge.
