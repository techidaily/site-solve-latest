_Leading provider of intelligent management solutions bolsters platform with artificial intelligence technology for automatic classification of documents and other information_

[M-Files Corporation](http://www.m-files.com), a provider of a new class of intelligent information management solutions that dramatically improve how organizations manage documents and other information, today announced a partnership with [ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a global provider of intelligent capture, optical character recognition, innovative language-based and artificial intelligence technologies.

M-Files is integrating ABBYY technology into its intelligent information management platform to further simplify and improve the way information assets can be categorized and organized. The result is a more intelligent and streamlined information environment that ensures consistency in how content is categorized and intelligently linked to other relevant data, content and processes to deliver a 360-degree view of structured data and unstructured content in different business systems.

This is made possible with ABBYY technology, which leverages artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) to understand text in context. Based on algorithms that analyze the meaning of words and reveal the relationships between them, even complex and unstructured documents can be classified accurately.

"Our partnership with ABBYY brings a strong complement of artificial intelligence capabilities to our core platform to further transform and automate the way our customers manage information and related processes," says Mika Javanainen, vice president of product management at M-Files Corporation. "By assisting in the process of automatically categorizing files with metadata, ABBYY technology is like jet fuel to the M-Files metadata-driven architecture, intelligently offloading users from repetitive tasks while making information more easily discoverable across the organization."

"Getting the right information to the right person at the right time is key in todayâ€™s fast-paced world, but the majority of content that businesses rely on is unstructured, which hinders businesses from leveraging machine-based processing and automation," said Sven Diedrich, Director Business Unit Technology Licensing at ABBYY Europe. "Our partnership with M-Files will help businesses harness this valuable unstructured content with simple automatic classification that establishes context and relevance, making it easy for users to quickly transform into actionable information."
