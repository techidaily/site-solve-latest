[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) has been recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a Leader in Everest Group’s Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) Products PEAK Matrix Assessment 2022\. Organizations worldwide rely on Everest Group’s IDP PEAK Matrix to evaluate the best solutions that understand business documents and find meaning in a human-like manner. ABBYY is positioned high for its market impact and vision & capability with ABBYY Vantage, the industry’s only low-code/no-code intelligent document processing solution that integrates easily into any intelligent automation platform, and its cognitive skills that are auto discoverable across many RPA systems, chatbots, and mobile apps.

ABBYY Vantage stands out because it is document processing reimagined. It was designed for how people work today with its out-of-the-box capability to separate documents by type and accurately extract all the relevant data as well as the ability to get smarter and more accurate over time.   
Customers can more quickly and easily scale Vantage across their organization, and most pointedly, they are finding it as a superior replacement for their existing legacy capture solutions. We’re proud to see that our continuous innovation has placed us again as a Leader in Everest Group’s latest IDP PEAK Matrix.

The PEAK Matrix is a proprietary framework for assessing the relative market success and overall capability of providers based on performance, experiences, ability, and knowledge. Each provider is comparatively assessed on two dimensions: market impact and vision & capability. ABBYY’s market impact was measured across revenue, number of clients, year-over-year growth, client portfolio mix, and value delivered to clients. ABBYY’s vision & capability was measured across vision & strategy, document processing capability, monitoring & improvement, implementation and support, and commercial models. Everest Group analysts also interviewed ABBYY customers.
