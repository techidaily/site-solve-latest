## Top 5 WMV Players Mac to Play WMV Files on Mac with Ease

### No.1: 5KPlayer – Free 4K Video Player for Mac/Windows 10

Serving as a versatile multimedia player for high definition videos, 5KPlayer is able to play WMV files on Mac up to 8K/5K/4K UHD or 1080P/720P HD without installing any other third-party plug-ins. In addition to WMV file format, this media player also plays almost all mainstream video audio formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, MPEG, FLV, 3GP, M2TS, DivX, MP3, AAC, AC3, WMA, FLAC, AIF, etc. on both Macs and Windows PCs. Also, the quite new AV1, VP9 and HEVC coding formats are also supported by 5KPlayer.

Typical errors include VLC 4K choppy, VLC HDR washed out colors, VLC can’t play MKV, etc.
