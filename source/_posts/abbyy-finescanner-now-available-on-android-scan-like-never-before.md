**ABBYY**, a leading global provider of document recognition, content capture and language-based technologies and solutions, announced today that one of its most advanced OCR-powered mobile scanners ****ABBYY FineScanner** is now available to Android users. Starting today anyone with an Android smartphone and tablet can use unparalleled ABBYY technology to scan and capture text from any kind of printed materials: business documents, receipts, newspapers and magazines, presentation slides, advertisements and even billboards – with unprecedented image quality, OCR accuracy and easy sharing capabilities.

A winner of the SUPERSTAR Mobile Star Awards™ for high-resolution scanning of printed and hand-written text, **ABBYY FineScanner** not only takes a photo of the document like a regular digital camera, but also automatically corrects the perspective to generate the rectangular and upright image, crops away unnecessary borders (the table the document is on, for example), uses black and white, color or grayscale filters to eliminate noise, enhance contrast and brightness. The resulting copy is optimized for viewing and printing; you can export it as a multipage PDF or a JPEG image.

**ABBYY FineScanner** can extract text from scanned images in 193 languages including Chinese, Japanese and Korean – all while retaining the original formatting of the document: markers, tables, headers and titles. The results can be saved in 12 most popular formats like DOCX, XLS and PDF and shared with colleagues and friends via email, messengers, social media or a cloud storage.

The high quality of scanning and recognition is achieved through the innovative ****ABBYY** Mobile Imaging and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies available for mobile devices as well. __“****ABBYY** technologies are recognized all over the world. Big international IT companies who provide text recognition and data input stream solutions license them. Now these cutting-edge technologies are available to every Android device user out there”_, comments ****ABBYY** Vice President and Head of Mobile ****Artem Kumpel**.

**ABBYY FineScanner** is designed for personal and corporate use. For example, it can be helpful for professionals who work with a lot of documentation outside the office – insurance agents, financial service representatives and lawyers.

**Compatibility, pricing and availability:**

****ABBYY FineScanner** for Android is compatible with Android 4.2 or later with camera autofocus. The application is available on Google Play in ****two versions**:

1. Free application with a premium subscription for advanced features, including OCR and ad removal ($4.99 a month or $19.99 a year)
2. One-time purchase version for $39.99 which includes all the advanced features and future updates

**ABBYY FineScanner** supports English and Russian as interface languages.
